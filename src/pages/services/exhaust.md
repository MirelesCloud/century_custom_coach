sub-title: "Muffler Repair & Exhaust Service"
description: "Your exhaust system really starts at the front of your car, right behind your engine. Exhaust manifolds connect to the cylinder heads, where they collect exhaust gases. As the gases move through the exhaust system, they're first analyzed by oxygen sensors, then refined by the catalytic converter and, finally, muffled by the muffler.

So by the time those gases leave the vehicle, your emission system has made your car run smoother, cleaner, and quieter."

text: "Your car battery is essential to your car’s engine to keep it running for a long period of time. Cold weather and other issues can really wear the battery down. In most cases, the battery does not give warning signs when it is about to fail. A battery three years old or older should be checked or replaced. Refer to your owner’s manual for factory recommended maintenance intervals for your vehicle. However, if your battery does show any of the following signs, bring your vehicle to Century Custom Coach today for a car battery replacement and service."
