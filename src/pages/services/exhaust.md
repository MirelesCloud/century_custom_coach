description: "Your exhaust system really starts at the front of your car, right behind your engine. Exhaust manifolds connect to the cylinder heads, where they collect exhaust gases. As the gases move through the exhaust system, they're first analyzed by oxygen sensors, then refined by the catalytic converter and, finally, muffled by the muffler.

So by the time those gases leave the vehicle, your emission system has made your car run smoother, cleaner, and quieter."
