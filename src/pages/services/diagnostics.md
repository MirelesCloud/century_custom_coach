text: "During your inspection, a knowledgeable technician will visually examine your tires, fluid levels, belts, lights, wipers, battery, hoses, and more. They'll keep an eye out for any existing problems or soon-to-be problems, so that you can either have them fixed on-the-spot or start budgeting for an important repair in the near future. By catching potential issues early, a car inspection will not only save you time, money, and headaches. Itâ€™ll also extend the life of your vehicle."
